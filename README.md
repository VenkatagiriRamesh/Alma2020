The Alma2020 repository is the project space of the team ALMA2020 - Mishmash Online Hackathon.

The sales prediction tool is developed thoughtful planning of data, user-experience, performance, and stability. The tool designed is integrated with the Machine-Learning model for the purpose of prediction.

The machine learning model is developed with Microsoft Azure - Machine Learning Toolsuite, to ensure the development of best performance models and algorithms. A total of 45 models were compared for various performance metrics and the best among the models is interfaced with the tool.

The details and metrics of the Machine Learning model are,
Algorithm name : VotingEnsemble
Accuracy : 99.262 %
Explained variance : 0.99482
Mean absolute error : 5.7975
Mean absolute percentage error : 1.8326
Median absolute error : 3.0547
Normalized mean absolute error : 0.013966
Normalized median absolute error : 0.0073588
Normalized root mean squared error : 0.019280
Normalized root mean squared log error : 0.017053
Root mean squared error : 8.0033
Root mean squared log error : 0.024253
Spearman correlation : 0.99429

The frontend of the tool is developed with Javascript and interface with Python in the backend. This is facilitated by the Flask Framework.
The template for GUI was developed with Jinja 2 Template Language.

The most driving features of the sales are in the following order of importance,
